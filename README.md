# Hacking-Food---Team-Harvey-Willey

This repo contains all our relevant jupyter notebooks and Data. The one file we couldnt upload was the tanzanian-nps [Tanzanian data](TanzanianNPS/tanzanian_nps.rar) data because it was too large. I made a Zip folder with it so just needs to be unpacked

HackingFood_HarveyWiley.ipynb [Notebook](HackingFood_HarveyWiley.ipynb) is our file to be used as a final submission

The other documents represent our collaberation from different intervals of the project that we compiled into a Jupyter Notebook. The only file needed to understand the project is the notebook linked in line 5. Some files may seem familiar since they were the original project files given to everyone. Finnaly the Tanzanian and indianICRISAT directories are for storing the final databases and files we need.
